        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm a passionate and dedicated developer currently pursuing my
          degree in Computer Science and Web Development. I specialize in
          front-end development and am always looking for innovative ways to
          bring designs to life with clean, efficient code. I'm also deeply
          interested in cutting-edge technologies, including quantum computing
          and its impact on computer security. In addition to my academic
          pursuits, I enjoy tackling real-world coding challenges, whether it's
          creating interactive web applications or exploring the latest trends
          in programming. With a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, HTML,
          CSS, and Java, I am focused on building scalable and user-friendly
          solutions. I am currently working on several projects, including a
          sustainability-focused website and an individual report on the future
          of quantum computing. I love collaborating on projects and am always
          eager to learn more about how technology shapes our world. When I'm
          not coding, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest tech trends and
          pushing the limits of what I can create. You can find me experimenting
          with new tools, working on my personal projects, or helping others
          overcome challenges in tech. Feel free to explore my website to see
          some of my work and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or chat
          about technology!

              I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the
              University of Westminster, with a strong focus on Web Development.
              My academic journey and personal interests have aligned toward
              front-end and full-stack development. I am actively working on
              various web design and development projects to deepen my practical

            <p>
              I completed my school education at Royal College, Colombo 07,
              where I studied from 2010 to 2024. I successfully passed my GCE
              Advanced Level examination in the Physical Science stream, with
              subjects including Combined Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics.
              This academic focus helped me develop strong analytical and
              critical thinking skills. Prior to that, I achieved excellent
              results at the GCE Ordinary Level examination, obtaining 8 A's and
              1 B. My deep interest in IT inspired me to pursue higher education
              in Computer Science. In addition to academics, I was actively
              involved in extracurricular activities—I represented my school in
              rugby and was a member of the Murclive Media Unit, where I
              contributed to media production and played key roles in organizing
              school events.
