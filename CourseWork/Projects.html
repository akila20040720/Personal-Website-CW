    <h2>My Journey in Building Digital Experiences: From Data to Design</h2>
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve been exploring the intersection of code, creativity, and user experience — turning
      ideas into functional, elegant digital solutions. My portfolio showcases a range of projects that reflect my
      growth as a web developer and technology enthusiast, from front-end design to data-driven analysis.</p>

      <h3>From Code Logic to User Flow: The Developer Side</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-10-25T20:59">October 25, 2025 at 8:59 PM</time>
      <p>My journey began with a strong foundation in Python, where I worked on scenario-based problems involving input
        validation, data visualization, and file operations.
        One of my early projects analyzed vehicle traffic data, featuring functions to validate user inputs, count
        nighttime vehicle activity, and visualize hourly traffic patterns using histograms enhanced with average
        markers.
        These experiences taught me how data accuracy and usability go hand-in-hand even the smallest validation check
        can dramatically improve user trust and application performance.</p>

      <h3>United Motors Vehicle Sales Dashboard</h2>
       <time datetime="2025-06-25T22:59">June 06, 2025 at 10:59 PM</time>
      <p>One of my proudest projects was creating a Vehicle Sales Dashboard for United Motors Sri Lanka, built using
        Access, MySQL and PowerBI.

        The goal was to analyze vehicle stock levels, pre-delivery inspections (PDI), and sales performance using real
        data from RMV and internal inventory sources. I designed the system to provide managers with interactive views,
        allowing them to filter vehicles by model, status, and sales region helping them make data-driven decisions
        quickly and efficiently.</p>

      <p>Key Features Included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactive charts showing monthly and yearly sales trends.</li>
        <li>Automated summaries of available vs. sold units by model.</li>
        <li>Linked Access database for structured vehicle information.</li>
        <li>Dynamic formulas and conditional formatting for visual insights.</li>
      </ul>
     <p>Through this project, I learned the importance of data relationships, query optimization, and presentation
          clarity ensuring that complex datasets become actionable intelligence for business users.</p>

      <h3>Sustainafy: Building for a Better Tomorrow</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-02-25T22:59">February 25, 2025 10.59pm</time>
      <p>As part of my Web Design and Development coursework at the University of Westminster, my team and I developed
        Sustainafy, a website dedicated to Sustainable Cities and Communities, inspired by one of the UN’s Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs).

        We took design inspiration from Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra website — focusing on simplicity, responsiveness, and
        visual storytelling. My contribution centered on front-end development, where I refined layouts using HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript, creating an intuitive and elegant interface.

        This project solidified my love for clean, purposeful design that communicates as effectively as it functions.
